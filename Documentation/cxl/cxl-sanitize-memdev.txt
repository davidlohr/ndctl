cxl-sanitize-memdev(1)
======================

NAME
----
cxl-sanitize-memdev - Perform a cryptographic destruction or sanitization
of the contents of the given memdev(s).

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'cxl sanitize-memdev <mem0> [<mem1>..<memN>] [<options>]'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'sanitize-memdev' command performs two different methods of sanitization,
per the CXL 3.0+ specification. The default is 'sanitize', but additionally,
a 'secure-erase' option is available. It is required that the memdev be
disabled before sanitizing, such that the device cannot be actively decoding
any HPA ranges at the time.

A device Sanitize is meant to securely re-purpose or decommission it. This
is done by ensuring that all user data and meta data, whether it resides
in persistent capacity, volatile capacity, or the label storage area,
is made permanently unavailable by whatever means is appropriate for
the media type. This sanitization request is merely submitted to the
kernel, and the completion is asynchronous. Depending on the medium and
capacity, sanitize may take tens of minutes to many hours. Subsequently,
'cxl wait-sanitizeâ€™ can be used to wait for the memdevs that are under
the sanitization.
